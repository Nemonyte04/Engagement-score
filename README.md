# Engagement-score
 The project automate the process to store alumni engagement scores in a database. Alumni are scored from 1 to 10 on four metrics - Communication, Expereintial, Philanthropic, and Volunteer. How many times they have demonstrated each one of these qualities is recorded in an excel sheet, which is unique for each quality. So for example, the excel sheet for communication will just contain all the constitutent IDs for each instance they demonstrated communication. If alumni 1 showed communication 2 times, it will record their id number twice. The data from all four sheets needs to be compiled in a final excel file, which has 5 columns - ID, date of entry, source, type, description. Description is basically how many times their ID has appeared in the respective file. For example, if ID 200 appears 5 times in communication file, its score is 5. This has an cap imit of 10 i.e. if an alumni ID appears 12 times, it's score will still be 10. Exception: for the philanthropic file, if ID even appears once, the score will be 10. I have uploaded 5 example files, one for each quality, and then the final excel which is imported into the database
